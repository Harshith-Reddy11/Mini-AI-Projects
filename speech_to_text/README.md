## 🛠 Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- [SpeechRecognition](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/)

Install dependencies with:
```
pip install SpeechRecognition
```

> **Note:**  
> This script uses the built-in `winsound` module for beep sounds (Windows only).  
> For microphone input, you may also need to install [PyAudio](https://pypi.org/project/PyAudio/):
> ```
> pip install pyaudio
> ```

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Run the script:**
   ```
   python speech_to_text.py

   - `2` for audio file input (enter the path to a WAV/FLAC file)
   - `3` to change language
   - `4` to exit

4. **View and save results:**  
   - The transcription, confidence score (if available), and detected ambient noise energy are shown in the terminal.
   - You can save the result to `transcription.txt`.

5. **Repeat or exit:**
